# Image_super_resolution
Image super resolution using autoencoder

The following things have been done in this project
- Download the "image super resolution (from unsplash)" dataset and split it's validation set to new validation set and test set.
- Design and train an AutoEncoder using `PyTorch` (not `TensorFlow`) on the dataset to enhance the resolution of images from low resolution to high resolution.
- Plot learning curve and visualize low resolution images of test set, their corresponding high resolution images and their reconstructed versions side by side.
